LocalLove is a web and mobile application designed to connect local volunteers with community members who need assistance with tasks such as grocery shopping, running errands, and other non-medical tasks. The goal of LocalLove is to create a network of volunteers who can help those in need, especially during difficult times such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

LocalLove allows community members to request assistance through the app, and volunteers can sign up to provide help. The app provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for both community members and volunteers.

LocalLove also includes an admin dashboard that allows administrators to manage the app's users, tasks, and other settings. The admin dashboard includes features such as user management, task management, and reporting.
